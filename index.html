				<strong>Personal Background:</strong>
					 I grew up and always lived in Illinois, but I moved to Concord, NC in May of 2019. In 2020 I moved to Belmont, NC and still live here.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Professional Background:</strong>
					 I currently work at Amazon and have for nearly 2 1/2 years now.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Academic Background:</strong>
					 I graduated high school in 2016 from Warrensburg-Latham High School, and started that fall at Parkland College. I only finished my freshman year there and my life fell apart so I dropped out. I moved 12 hours away and started at CPCC in Fall of 2019. I figured if I moved far away from the excuses I was making to keep myself from going back to school I’d have to go back, and it’s working!

        <strong>Background in this subject:</strong>
           In high school I did dual credit classes through the Heartland Technical Academy, which is through Richland Community College. That’s when I started messing around with Raspberry Pi’s and decided at least to a point that coding was exciting, even though it irritated me, but I loved being able to problem solve and figure out what I was doing wrong. I’m working on an associate degree in Full Stack Programming currently at CPCC, and plan to be finished in May of 2022!

				<strong>Funny/Interesting item about myself:</strong>
					I have 23 piercings and 5 tattoos, I’d have more if I wasn’t a wage slave to Jeff Bezos and wasn’t a broke college student.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>I'd also like to share:</strong>
					 I’m 12 hours from home with no family, but moving away has been the best thing I've ever done for myself!
